# 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Every push to the **main** branch automatically triggers the GitHub Actions workflow.

Pipeline stages:

1. Checkout source code
2. Install dependencies
3. Build application
4. Build Docker images
5. Push images to Docker Hub
6. Update Kubernetes manifests
7. ArgoCD synchronizes the application
8. Deploy latest version
